# Accessing Code ROME Branches

This repository currently exposes all development work on the `work` branch.
To review the latest changes locally:

1. Clone the repository (or update your existing clone):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd code_rome
   ```
2. Fetch the latest history and check out the working branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout work
   ```

> **Note**
> The branch name `codex/add-interactive-cli` referenced in previous notes does not exist on the remote. The
> interactive CLI work is included on `work`.

If you prefer an online environment, GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod both provide full terminals where you can
run the same commands above without installing tooling locally.
